<h1> There are three different problems on the first day ...</h1>





<h3>In the first problem, how to connect NodeMCU with LDR sensor, and how to send and store the data received from it to the IOT cloud base, we will see first.</h3>

<h3>This is similar to the first problem. Just apply some condition here, LED will represent the condition.</h3>

<h3>In this problem, three values will be input together, Humidity, Temperature, and val. It is being treated as an agricultural project. Means some conditions will be applied here, if the humidity decreases then automatically the motor will start and the water will come out. In this way some more conditions will apply.</h3>
