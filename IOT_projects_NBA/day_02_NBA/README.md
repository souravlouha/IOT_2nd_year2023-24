<h1>In the first problem we will see that with the help of node MCU and BLYNK APP, we can turn an LED remotely ON or OFF.</h1>
<h2>BLYNK is an iot platform, with the help of which many types of work can be done in iot projects. Both mobile APP and WEB VERSION of BLYNK have to work together, with the help of which IOT related projects can be done very easily.</h2>
<h2>You can see the on/off button in the picture below, if I turn that button on or off from the Android i.e. mobile or web version, then in my circuit, without any wire connection, the given output i.e. LED light will turn on and off.</h2>

<h1>In the second problem we will see that through a touch sensor, how we can turn on or off the output i.e. LED by the node mcu.</h1>
<h2>We can turn this output i.e. LED on or off in two ways in this problem, the first part is through touch sensor and the second part is through BLYNK APP like in the first problem.</h2>
<h2>That is, when we turn on the light with the touch sensor, the LED switch will be turned on in our mobile or web version.</h2>

<h1>In this third problem, with the help of DHT11 sensor two variables, (those variables are temperature and humidity) inputs, those data have to be uploaded to firebase.</h1>
<h2>A main container should be created in firebase, which is DHT container, under this DHT container two more subcontainers should be created, one will be temperature and the other will be humidity.</h2>
<h2>These two containers, one for temperature and the other for humidity, will store data for the inputs.</h2>
<h2>And Firebest will continuously take input from sensors, and continuously show it on Firebest's monitor.</h2>
