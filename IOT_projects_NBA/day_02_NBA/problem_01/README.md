<h1>In the first problem we will see that with the help of node MCU and BLYNK APP, we can turn an LED remotely ON or OFF.</h1>
  
<h2>  BLYNK is an iot platform, with the help of which many types of work can be done in iot projects.
Both mobile APP and WEB VERSION of BLYNK have to work together, with the help of which IOT related projects can be done very easily.</h2>

<h1>How it's Work</h1>

<h2>You can see the on/off button in the picture below, if I turn that button on or off from the Android i.e. mobile or web version, then in my circuit, without any wire connection, the given output i.e. LED light will turn on and off.</h2>
