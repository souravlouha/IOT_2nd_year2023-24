<h4>Machine learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criterion using example
data or past experience. We have a model defined up to some parameters, and learning is the
execution of a computer program to optimize the parameters of the model using the training data or
past experience. The model may be predictive to make predictions in the future, or descriptive to gain
knowledge from data, or both.
Arthur Samuel, an early American leader in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence,
coined the term “Machine Learning” in 1959 while at IBM. He defined machine learning as “the field of
study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” However, there is
no universally accepted definition for machine learning. Different authors define the term differently.</h4>

<h4>Supervised learning. Supervised learning models work with data that has been previously labeled. ...
Unsupervised learning. ...
Semi-supervised learning. ...
Reinforcement learning.</h4>
