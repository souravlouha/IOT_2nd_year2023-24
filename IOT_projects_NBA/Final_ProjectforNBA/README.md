# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

---
### 📘 Abstract
Plant diseases significantly reduce agricultural productivity and pose a threat to global food security. This project presents an end-to-end deep learning-based system for early detection of plant diseases using leaf images. The proposed system employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a curated dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaves. A Streamlit-powered web interface allows for real-time predictions, making it accessible for farmers and agricultural professionals.

### 🧠 Introduction
Timely and accurate identification of plant diseases is critical for ensuring high agricultural yield and food safety. Traditional manual methods are not only time-consuming but also require expert knowledge. In this project, we explore a data-driven approach that uses machine learning to classify plant diseases from images, enabling automated and scalable disease diagnosis.

---
### 🎯 Objectives
To develop a CNN-based model capable of classifying plant leaf diseases with high accuracy.

To build an intuitive user interface for non-technical users to perform predictions.

To provide a scalable and efficient solution that can be extended for mobile or IoT-based applications.

### 🛠️ System Architecture
#### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
Collected from publicly available datasets (e.g., PlantVillage).

Preprocessing steps included:

Image resizing and normalization

Data augmentation using OpenCV (rotation, flipping, zoom)

Conversion to grayscale/RGB format (as per model input)

#### 2. Model Training
Architecture: CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers

Framework: TensorFlow/Keras

Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

Epochs: 25–50 (tunable)

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

### 3. Deployment
The trained model was integrated into a Streamlit web app.

Allows users to upload images and view predictions in real-time.

Visual feedback provided with confidence scores and classification labels.
